### Scripts for Simulation Studies
There are 2 sub-directories: Simulation and Automation

Simulation includes intersect_snps.R, which intersect snps from different population that passed the plink filters based on MAF, so that all the study would have the same set of snps. Another script simulate_GCTA_v1.py randomly select snps in the designated regions and generate a beta based on the population size and significance level. format_sumstats.py (which Nathan wrote) would calculate zscores from the output of GCTA’s fastGWAS.
Automation includes MsCAVIAR_simulation.sh , which is the shell script that connect all the scripts together. The documentation should be pretty clear for each steps. capture.py  would capture the results of Caviar and MsCaviar, comparing them to the supposed results and calculate the set sizes and recall rates. paintor.R does the same for PAINTOR. susie2.R runs SuSiE and capture the results the same way as other methods.  MsCAVIAR_summary_results.sh  is just a convenient script that concatenate results from every region and every method to one file to make it easier for me to open them in Excel or R.
